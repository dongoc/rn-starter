## 3-2. FlatList Element
- turns an **array** into a **list** of elements
- we are required to pass in a 'prop' of **'data'** - the array of data that we are going to create a bunch of elements out of 
- also required to pass in a **'renderItem'** prop (functio that will turn each individual item into an element)
- if you are coming from React on the web, you might be used to 'mapping' an array of data to build a list - FlatList is better with RN
